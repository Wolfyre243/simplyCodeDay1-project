# LifeHack Hackathon 2024 Project

This is a project that was made by Wolfyre243 and Gmorcad
We started as poor beginners
24 hours before the hackathon we got up and started learning programming and got really good after the 12th hour. We built stuff like an AI and a nuclear weapon simulation with the experience.
